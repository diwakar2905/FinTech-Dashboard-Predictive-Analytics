## Overview

In the fast-paced world of finance, timely and accurate data analysis is crucial. This project aims to provide a powerful yet intuitive tool for financial analysts, traders, and enthusiasts. By combining a real-time data fetching mechanism with a suite of analytical and predictive models, the platform empowers users to:

- **Visualize** historical stock performance and key technical indicators.
- **Analyze** market trends and volatility.
- **Assess** potential credit risk or detect fraudulent activities through integrated machine learning models.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly web interface built with **Streamlit** to visualize complex financial datasets, including candlestick charts, moving averages, and trading volumes.
- **On-Demand Data**: Fetches historical stock market data using the `yfinance` library and caches it locally for performance.
- **Technical Analysis**: Implements various technical indicators (e.g., SMA, EMA, RSI) using the `ta` library to help users identify trading signals.
- **Volatility Analysis**: Analyzes and visualizes stock volatility using a **GARCH(1,1)** model to understand risk.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Calculates optimal portfolio allocations based on **Markowitz Portfolio Theory**, visualizing the Efficient Frontier for multiple assets.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - **Directional Prediction**: Predicts the next day's price direction (Up/Down) using a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on technical indicators.
  - **Credit Risk Assessment**: (Placeholder) A trained model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults based on applicant data.
  - **Fraud Detection**: (Placeholder) A model to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diwakar2905/FinTech-Dashboard-Predictive-Analytics.git
cd FinTech-Dashboard-Predictive-Analytics
```

### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies and avoid conflicts.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How to Run

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit dashboard.

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Run the `app.py` script using Streamlit.

```bash
streamlit run fintech-dashboard/app.py
```

3.  Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the dashboard through the sidebar and main panel.

1.  **Single-Stock Analysis**:
    -   Use the sidebar dropdown to select a stock ticker (e.g., MSFT, AAPL).
    -   The main panel will display the candlestick chart, GARCH volatility analysis, and the next-day price direction forecast for the selected stock.

2.  **Portfolio Optimization**:
    -   In the sidebar, enter a comma-separated list of stock tickers for your desired portfolio (e.g., `AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL,AMZN`).
    -   The main panel will display the Efficient Frontier graph and provide the optimal portfolio weights for both maximum Sharpe ratio and minimum volatility.
